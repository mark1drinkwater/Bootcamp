/*
    Historical context: The area now known as Franklin County has a long history of Native American habitation, 
	with several Native American tribes calling the area home for centuries before European settlement. 
	Some of these tribes, including the Mohawk and the St. Regis Mohawk, continue to have a presence in the county today.

    Tribal sovereignty: The St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, which spans parts of Franklin County and neighboring St. Lawrence County,
	is a federally recognized Indian reservation with a sovereign government. This has led to a significant Native American population in the area.

    Economic opportunities: The St. Regis Mohawk Reservation has created economic opportunities for its residents through the development of businesses
	such as casinos and manufacturing facilities. This has drawn Native Americans from other areas to the reservation and nearby communities, increasing
	the overall proportion of American Indian population in the county.

    Cultural attractions: The Franklin County area also has several cultural attractions related to Native American history and heritage, 
	including the Akwesasne Cultural Center and the Six Nations Indian Museum, which may draw visitors and residents interested in Native American culture.
