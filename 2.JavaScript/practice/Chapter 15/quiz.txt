1. What are JavaScript libraries and frameworks?
Libraries are basically pre-programmed JavaScript
modules that you can use to speed up your development process. 
They typically do one specific thing for you. Frameworks are very similar, they are also
pre-programmed, but instead of doing only one thing for you, they arrange a whole
list of things. This is why it is called a framework, it really is providing you a solid
place to start from and usually demands a certain structure for your files in order to
do so. A framework is often a bundle of libraries that provide an all-in-one solution.
