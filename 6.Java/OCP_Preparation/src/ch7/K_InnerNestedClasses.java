/*
A nested class is a class that is defined within another class. A nested class can come in one
of four flavors.
â–  Inner class: A non-static type defined at the member level of a class
â–  Static nested class: A static type defined at the member level of a class
â–  Local class: A class defined within a method body
â–  Anonymous class: A special case of a local class that does not have a name

// Inner Class:
/*
Inner classes have the following properties:
â–  Can be declared public, protected, package, or private
â–  Can extend a class and implement interfaces
â–  Can be marked abstract or final
â–  Can access members of the outer class, including private members

        members (other than static constants) was removed. All four types of nested classes can
        now define static variables and methods!
